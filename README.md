## 🌿 Project Title
"EcoMission: Code for change"

## 🧩 Problem Statement Addressed  
"How might we build and deploy technology-driven solutions that actively promote cleaner, greener communities and environmental sustainability?"
"No motivation to adopt green habits."

## 🧠 Project Overview
EcoMission is a 7-day gamified web challenge that encourages users to perform real-life eco-friendly actions.  
To prevent false claims, users must enter unique codes distributed by event organizers, eco-clubs, or green action zones (e.g., recycling bins, clean-up drives) after completing an environmental action.  

The platform rewards users with eco-credits, tracks their progress, and celebrates their honesty and sustainability efforts through badges and animations.

Who it benefits:
- Students, volunteers, and citizens participating in green drives  
- Eco-club campaigns  
- NGOs promoting sustainability  
- Schools and communities conducting eco-challenges 

## 🌟 Key Features

- Code-Based Action Logging  
  Earn points only through valid one-time codes after performing an eco-action.

-  7-Day Credit Tracker
  Log one activity per day; view total eco-credits and daily status.

-  Gamified Rewards System  
  Confetti animations, badges, and eco-facts after each submission to increase motivation.

-LocalStorage for persistence

## 🔧 Challenges Faced
-It was challenging to stop users from faking eco-actions. We solved this by using unique, one-time codes given only after real-world actions. 
 These codes are checked entirely on the front end without needing a backend.

-Preventing users from faking eco-actions was a key challenge. We addressed this by using unique, 
 one-time codes distributed only after completing real-world tasks, with all validation handled on the front end without a backend.

-Validating code entries, limiting one submission per day, and saving user progress locally with localStorage required careful handling to avoid bugs, 
 especially since the app runs entirely without a backend or API.

## 🚀 Future Plans

-Add QR code scanner to auto-fill eco-codes
-Create a leaderboard with top eco-warriors
-Connect to a backend to track real-time stats globally

-After seven days are completed a possible reward is given
